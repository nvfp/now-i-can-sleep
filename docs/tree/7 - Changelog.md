# Changelog

- 3.0.0 (Jul 15-18):
    - Refactored the `_compile` command by excluding it from the PyPI distribution to reduce package size. It's because the `_compile` method is only used during the GitHub workflow and not by the users.
    - New features:
        - If users don't provide them, NICS will automatically create/use default for: favicon, 404 page, and `index.md` for docs-tree folders.
        - Added an "Edit this page" button so people can make changes on GitHub.
        - New options: `custom_license`, `char_map`
        - Users can now use custom `container` name and `Dock` branch name.
        - Added `reinit` command that lets users easily reconfigure NICS environment after NICS major update.
    - Breaking changes:
        - New URL mapping scheme
        - New plans for how `cmd_init`, `cmd_upgrade`, and `cmd_reinit` will work in the future.
