# My Dummy Blog Post

In this blog post, we will explore some cool programming concepts and write some code in different programming languages. 

## Introduction

Programming is a fascinating world filled with endless possibilities. Let's dive right in and explore some code examples.

## Python

Here's a simple Python code snippet to print "Hello, World!" to the console:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## JavaScript

Now, let's switch to JavaScript and create a function that adds two numbers:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

## HTML

HTML is not a programming language, but let's create a basic HTML page with a "Hello, World!" heading:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Dummy Blog</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we've seen some simple code examples in Python, JavaScript, and even HTML. Programming is a vast field, and there's always more to learn and explore. Stay curious and keep coding!

Happy coding!
